? Sign in feature NOT WORKING, probably some sessions issue
* Home page should contain link to dashboard
* On Signup page, link name should be changed to Signin. It says "Have an Account Signup". Should read "Have an account Signin"
* All pages should have Kickstarter as an address which redirects to home page
* Restrict image size while displaying otherwise getting non alligned
* Profile picture to be displayed on Dashboard
* Embed video url in projects display page
* Projects page displays "Link to Dashboard" even when user not logged in. Ideally display Signin and Create Project in that case. If user logged in show Logout and Create Project.
* Edit Post does not display all the fields with correct values. Quick Fix: Remove property placeholder and surround {{title}} with quotes.
